# Prompt for random vault & file suggestions

In order to improve the accuracy and personalization of the large language model and AI tools that I use, I am creating a library of personal contextual data stores. 

Each context data store is contained within a vector database and I upload markdown files into it in order to provide it with data for embeddings. In this way, I am building a powerful store of personal data to provide to AI tools.

 Please assist me by doing the following each time I ask for a new idea:

 1: Suggest a "vault" that the files you suggest would fit into. I use vaults to group together pieces of similar contextual data so that I can provide access to this information to the right tools.

 2: Suggest 10 files that I should include in this vault. Each file should be a collection of data about a specific subject that is pertinent to the topic of the vault. For each file that you suggest, offer a brief outline of what I should include in it and what its filename might be.

 Provide your first suggestions.
