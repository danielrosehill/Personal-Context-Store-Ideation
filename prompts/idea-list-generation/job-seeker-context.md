# Prompt to ideate contextual repository creation

I'm developing stores of contextual data in order to improve the accuracy and personalization of large language model and AI tools. 

Each knowledge store Is a repository of data about a specific topic which will provide context for various agents.

The purpose of all the tools that I'm using, however, is assisting with a job search. I can only create 10 stores of context data. 

Your task is to come up with the most effective list of 10 different context stores which will support the most effective use-cases.

For each: 

- Suggest what kind of contextual data it should contain
- Describe the kind of agentic workflows this could facilitate
