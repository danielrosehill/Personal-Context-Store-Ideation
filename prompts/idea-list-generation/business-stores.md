# Prompt to ideate contextual repository creation

I'm developing stores of contextual data in order to improve the accuracy and personalization of large language model and AI tools. 

 I am a small business owner providing consulting services to a mixture of clients, predominantly those in the technology sector, and drawing upon a mixture of inputs from communications to strategy with a particular interest in artificial intelligence.

I can only create exactly 10 context data stores in my system. So you need to choose the best selection that will be as effective as possible for the widest possible variety of use cases related to my business

Your task is to:

- Suggest what each data store should be

And for each one:

- Describe briefly the type of contextual data I should store there
- Describe the kind of agentic workflows this could facilitate
