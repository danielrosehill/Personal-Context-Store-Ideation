# Prompt to ideate contextual repository creation

I'm developing stores of contextual data in order to improve the accuracy and personalization of large language model and AI tools. 

Each knowledge store Is a repository of data about a specific topic which will provide context for various agents.

These context data stores are intended to enhance the utility of large language models for personal use. So don't suggest ideas for context stores that would only be relevant for businesses and business users. 

Let us also image that I am constrained to create no more than {number} different data stores. 

Your task is to:

- Suggest what each data store should be

And for each one:

- Describe briefly the type of contextual data I should store there
- Describe the kind of agentic workflows this could facilitate
