# Individual Doc Ideation

In order to improve the accuracy and personalization of the large language model and AI tools that I use, I have created a group of personal contextual data stores. 

Each context data store is contained within a vector database and I upload markdown files into it in order to provide it with data for embeddings. 

The context store that I'd like to work on populating today is: 

{store-name}

Its intended purpose is:

{intended use-case}

Your task is to suggest 10 files that I should upload to supply the store with context data. Each file should consist of a collection of pieces of context data on that theme. 

For each file that you suggest I create, give me some short guidelines on what kind of information I should include in it.
