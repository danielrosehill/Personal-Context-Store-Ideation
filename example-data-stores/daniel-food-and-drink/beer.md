# The kind of beer I like

I'm a fan of some kinds of craft beer. 

I love extremely bitter IPAs. The higher the IBU the better. 

I have a strict policy of only drinking beer by the pint or half liter. I refuse to drink beer in smaller quantities. The occasional time I find a liter of beer on the menu, I will order that or a pitcher. But I won't compromise on drinking bad beer just to drink from a larger container. 

I love Guinness and could drink it almost continuously. Craft stouts are nice too, so long as they don't get too adventurous and try to add flavorings. I also like Stout to be at the level of carbonation of Guinness or less. 

I don't drink non alcoholic beer. 

I like beers that are slightly stronger. 6 to 8% ABV is fun. But that's my cutoff.

Whenever I travel, I try to sample local beer, so long as it's not a beer that I really dislike. The only beers I really dislike are ones that try to integrate weird fruit flavorings. I'm not a fan of low quality beer and very bland lagers. Most other things are okay.

The other time I can find is available. I love drinking ale that is uncarbonated or close to it. If I can find that on tap, it's a definite attraction. 

I have a strong preference to drinking beer on draft (from the tap). In fact, I try to avoid drinking beer from bottles at almost all costs. 

I can drink IPAs all year. I prefer stout in the summer.
