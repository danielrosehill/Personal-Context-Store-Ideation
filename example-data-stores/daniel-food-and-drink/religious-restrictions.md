# Religious restrictions on food and drink

I am Jewish. 

I keep a basic standard of kosher And adhere to its standard laws. . 

I only eat kosher meat. My standard of kosher for meat is a basic rabbinical certification. 

I am an enthusiastic fan of vegan and vegetarian cuisine, however. So when it's hard to find kosher meat, I tend to default to cooking Indian veg curries.
