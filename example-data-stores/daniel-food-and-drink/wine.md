# Wine preferences

In order of preference, I like:

- Rose  
- White  
- Red  

I'm not a big wine connoisseur. I avoid wine that is bottom of the market if I can, but other than that I just try to find something that is drinkable and pleasant. 

I favor dry white wine and the driest rose that I can find. 

I have a terrible habit of ordering wine by the glass, then deciding that I want 4 glasses, then realizing it would have been cheaper to buy the bottle, then doing the same thing over and over again.
