# Cider preferences

I love extra dry cider. In fact, I don't think I've ever drunk a cider that I found too dry. 

Bulmers is about the sweetest cider that I can tolerate.

A good crisp, tart, dry cider served straight from the tap is close to my idea of cider perfection.  

I'm also a fan of Pear Cider. / perry. I've tried some apple and pear combinations, but I prefer to stick to one or the other. 

Like beer, I try to drink cider in half liters on tap.
