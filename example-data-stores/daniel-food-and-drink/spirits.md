# Spirits & Cocktails

I'm not a huge spirits drinker, but there are a few that I enjoy, at least on occasion:

- Vodka on the rocks. I like drinking vodka with ice and without sweeteners. 
- Absinthe. But I'm feeling adventurous, and the rare time I can find it on the menu I'll order a quality absinthe. But it has to be good absinthe as there's some terrible pseudoabsinthe on the market.
- For cocktails, I'll drink in a negroni or the most bitter alternative.A detailed outline of my preferences for various types of food and drink.
