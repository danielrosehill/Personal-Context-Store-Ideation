# General Food & Drink Preferences

In general, I am a fan of food with strong flavors. 

My favorite cuisines in approximate order of preference are:

- Indian
- Nepalese
- Thai
- Ethiopian
- Mexican

Bland food is my worst nightmare!

Food I enjoy at almost any occasion and time:

- Shawarma
- Kebab
- Curries

Besides food allergies and religious dietary restrictions covered in  a separate piece of context data, the only thing that I don't eat are organ meats and .... anything other than conventional meats. 

I know what I like and I'm pretty adverse to experimenting.
