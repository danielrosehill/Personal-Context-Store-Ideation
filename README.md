# Personal Contextual Data Store Ideation

09-Jan-25

Large language models can be rendered expotentially more powerful by the addition of small amounts of contextual data. 

To build on the previous work and experimentation I've done around this theme, this repository contains a few prompts and outputs designed to use AI to ideate the different contextual data stores that may be advantageous for this purpose. 

The idea here is to support the kind of implementation of RAG (for personal use) that is already available in many large language model front ends, including Open Web UI and others. 

I've looked at a few ways to develop data pipelines in order to allow users to develop these knowledge repositories locally and then push them into vector stores for embedding in LLM workflows.

 The purpose of this project is to develop a workflow to "seed" a starting bank of context data that can lay the groundwork for a rich data store segmented into different vaults for use with different agents. 

The objective in this, and all my experiments in finding ways to leverage personal contextual data is to achieve something that grows closer to delivering truly personalised experiences with LLMs.

## Assistant For Context Development 

This assistant provides randomized suggestions for vaults of personal context knowledge as well as individual files that should be populated within it, providing short descriptions for what those context data files should contain.

##  Starter Ideas For Personal Context Generation 

I've gathered some outputs from the assistant in the `starters` folder.

Those who share my enthusiasm about the huge potential of personal contextual data to generate better LLM outputs can begin their day by making a few cups of coffee, signing up for a good speech to text assistant, and working through the suggestions.  

Create the recommended knowledge stores (or those which make sense for your particular AI/LLM needs), jot down or record the requisite files, upload them when finished, set the right embedding settings, and finally, connect them to the assistants or agents that make sense.

While this process sounds tedious even as I write it out, doing this even a few times has already proven very useful. 


## Send Ideas, Thoughts!

I love getting emails from people who are also working on AI ideas, and especially trying to think about ways to better leverage personal context for the type of workflows rhat it can support so well
