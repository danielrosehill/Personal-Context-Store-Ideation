# Personal Contextual Data Store Ideation

09-Jan-25

Large language models can be rendered expotentially more powerful by the addition of small amounts of contextual data. 

To build on the previous work and experimentation I've done around this theme, this repository contains a few prompts and outputs designed to use AI to ideate the different contextual data stores that may be advantageous for this purpose. 

The idea here is to support the kind of implementation of RAG (for personal use) that is already available in many large language model front ends, including Open Web UI and others. 

I've looked at a few ways to develop data pipelines in order to allow users to develop these knowledge repositories locally and then push them into vector stores for embedding in LLM workflows.

 The purpose of this project is to develop a workflow to "seed" a starting bank of context data that can lay the groundwork for a rich data store segmented into different vaults for use with different agents. 

The objective in this, and all my experiments in finding ways to leverage personal contextual data is to achieve something that grows closer to delivering truly personalised experiences with LLMs.
